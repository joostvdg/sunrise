# sunrise

Demo application for calculating when the sun is rising on Public Cloud regions

## Sun Calculation Library

Using this library:  https://github.com/joostvdg/SunCalc-Java

This is a fork from https://github.com/florianmski/SunCalc-Java, which is inspired by https://github.com/mourner/suncalc.

Needed to fork, as to make sure there's a release in GitHub, so we can use JitPack.
